## Introduction

This is a [php][PHP] project is a fresh install of the [Laravel][laravel] framework for full stack web developer candidates. At this point, the Challenge app doesn't do much and it is up to you to change that.

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply [fork][fork] the [laravel-challenge][laravel-challenge] repository, then clone it locally, and install the dependencies with [composer][composer] and [npm][npm]

### The tools

You need to have Git installed locally so you can clone your fork of the laravel-challenge repository.
You can get Git from [http://git-scm.com/][git], or with your preferred package manager.

You must have [PHP][php] 7.0+ installed, with the PHP executable file available on your PATH.

We also use the [Composer][composer] dependency manager for managing dependencies on 3rd-party libraries.
You can follow the [instructions on the Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#introduction).

If you are going to focus on the front aspects we recommendo you to use the [npm](npm) and

As far as tools, the app must:

- Be implemented in the [Laravel Framework][laravel]
- Use either mysql, mariadb or SQLite for persistent data
- Show good versioning control practices (*The commits will be evaluated*)

### Forking

Fork the [laravel-challenge][laravel-challenge] repository on GitHub (if you are unfamiliar with forking, [follow these instructions][fork]).

Then clone *your* repository locally using [Git][git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/laravel-challenge.git
cd laravel-challenge
```

*Note: Be sure to replace the URL with the correct URL to your forked repository.*

### Install Dependencies

All 3rd-party dependencies are managed with the [Composer][composer]  and [npm][npm] managers.
If you have installed Composer globally, as recommended, you can simply run:

```
composer install
npm install
```

### Preping the application

As any new [Laravel][lararel] install there is a couple steps to perform in order to get it going. If you are nunfamiliar follow [these instrunctions](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/#web-server-configuration)

### Run the Application

The simplest way to run the app is through the `artisan server`, which relies on the built-in PHP server.
To start the web server, run the following command from the project's root directory:

```
php artisan serve
```

You can then browse to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your web browser.
